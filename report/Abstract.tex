Vixen 3 is a fully featured, free and open-source application facilitating the design and playback of lighting sequences. It is particularly suited to the animation of holiday lighting, the variety and flexibility of which have increased dramatically in the past few years. However, as displays become more sophisticated, the original engine will need an increasing amount of processing power for real-time rendering. To resolve this problem, a new playback engine was developed in this project. This engine works based on pre-rendering the sequence to reduces runtime computations. As a result, complex display controls are now possible on hardware platforms with relatively less processing power, especially embedded devices. This can greatly increase the flexibility, reduce the hardware requirement and cost of setting up lighting displays.
