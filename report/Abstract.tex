\cmt{The abstract is written here. This should concisely state the main aim of the work and the achievements.}

Vixen 3 is a fully featured, free and open-source application facilitating the design and playback of lighting sequences. It is particularly suited to the animation of holiday lighting, the variety and flexibility of which have increased dramatically in the past few years. However, as displays become more sophisticated, the original engine will need an increasing amount of processing power for real-time rendering. A new playback engine was developed in this project. This engine based on pre-rendering the sequence, reduces runtime computations. As a result, complex display controls are now possible on hardware platforms with relatively less processing power, including embedded devices. This can greatly reduce the requirement and cost of setting up lighting displays.
