\PARstart{\ca{I}}{\ca{n}} \ca{this chapter, the \cc{performance} of different implementations were compared. Video encoding formats were also analysed in order to find an optimal encoding format for exported sequences.}

\section{Playback engine}

\fref{fig:playback} shows the performance of the \ca{new} playback engine \ca{on the same Microsoft Windows-based platform} using \ca{an exported} ``Raw'' sequence. \cc{During} the first and the last few seconds, the playback engine stopped, \cc{and} the original execution engine was used instead during idle state. The execution engine still uses around $30 \%$ of CPU time during idle\cc{,} but as soon as playback started, CPU usages \cc{dropped} to around $6 \%$ with stable refresh frame rates. \ca{The new playback engine requires much less computational power compared to the original execution engine.}

\end{figure}

\section{Console application}

\ca{For Linux-based platforms, the console application \texttt{VixenConsole} was used for various performance \cc{analyses}.}

\subsection{Loading performance}

On an embedded platform with limited \ca{computational} power, the loading of \texttt{VixenConsole} and all controller modules can take significant time. The \texttt{tidy} operation can reduce a small portion of the loading time by remove unused settings for elements and filters\ca{, which} also reduces the size of XML \ca{configuration files}.

However, it still takes \ca{about 30 seconds} from starting \texttt{VixenConsole} to \ca{be able to render} on the \ca{Raspberry Pi B} platform\ca{, in \cc{contrast} to only \cc{five} seconds on the Raspberry Pi 3B platform}. This loading time is for the mono runtime to \cb{perform} some necessary tasks such as \cb{loading modules and} dynamic \ca{recompilation}, \ca{and is} unavoidable.

\subsection{Execution performance}

\fref{fig:raw-seq-p-c} compares the performance between \texttt{VixenLinky} and \texttt{VixenConsole} on multiple platforms. The performance comparison was done by \ca{unlimiting} the playback and controller refresh \cb{rates} separately \cb{with} both \texttt{VixenLinky} and \texttt{VixenConsole} applications\ca{;} a total of \ca{four} tests on each of the platforms. The refresh rate data over the entire sequence time \ca{is} then summarised \ca{using} a five-number summary representation, i.e. sample minimum, lower quartile, median, upper quartile and sample maximum. The mean values were also plotted as points. The refresh rate axis is \cb{in} log scale to focus on the lower performance figures over all platforms.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Figs/raw-seq-p-c.eps}
  \caption{\footnotesize Performance comparison between \texttt{VixenLinky} and \texttt{VixenConsole}}
  \label{fig:raw-seq-p-c}
\end{figure}

By separating playback and controller update tests, the two major performance limitation factors of file IO and processing power can be separately tested.

The figure shows \ca{that} \texttt{VixenConsole} runs a few times slower than the minimal implementation \texttt{VixenLinky}. On \cc{the} NP1380, the controller refresh rate drops below 10 fps, unusable for a 50 fps sequence. It still performs adequately on \cc{the} Raspberry Pi B\ca{;} both the maximum possible playback and controller refresh rate were significantly higher than 50 fps.

\ca{\section{Analysis}}

The mono profiler was used in an attempt to \ca{further optimise the \texttt{VixenConsole} application} on \ca{the} Raspberry Pi B platform. However, it was not particularly \ca{successful}. As shown \ca{in} \lref{lst:mono_sample}, \ca{there are not any significant performance optimisation opportunities available. The} thread sleeping method, \ca{IO read} methods and update methods are all \ca{mandatory and} just as expected. Some overheads from copying command arrays do show up on the summary as array coping methods, but they are \ca{insignificant, \cc{and are}} unavoidable for controller module interface compatibility.

\section{Platform comparison}

\fref{fig:raw-seq-p-c} clearly shows the relative performance figures of all testing platforms. The NP1380 platform is unable to meet the minimum \cc{requirements} of 50 fps sequences\ca{. Therefore, it was excluded from \cc{the} \texttt{VixenConsole} performance and video format analysis.}

\section{Video formats}

\subsection{Benefits and limitations}

The first noticeable benefit \ca{of encoding an exported sequence to a video file} was reduction in sequence file size. The ``Raw'' sequence format was implemented without any compression, \ca{and} \cc{each file} always has a size linear to \cc{the} total sequence time and channel count. The video formats reduced the sequence size to around $\nicefrac{1}{10}$ of the ``Raw'' sequence. \tref{tbl:size} compares file sizes in different formats of the same example sequence.

\begin{table}[t]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
    \hline
    \textbf{Type} & \textbf{Sequence size} & \textbf{With audio} \\ \hline
    \hline
    Editable sequence                                 & 8.88 MiB  & 24.4 MiB  \\ \hline
    \hline
    50 fps exported \texttt{Raw} sequence             & 337 MiB   & 352 MiB   \\ \hline
    50 fps \cc{\texttt{rgb24}-encoded} video (lossless)    & 26.6 MiB  & 42.5 MiB  \\ \hline
    50 fps \cc{\texttt{yuv444p}-encoded} video (lossless)  & 26.6 MiB  & 42.5 MiB  \\ \hline
    50 fps \cc{texttt{yuv420p}-encoded} video (lossy)     & 18.2 MiB  & 34.1 MiB  \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{\footnotesize File size comparison of different formats}
  \label{tbl:size}
\end{table}

Using the video format, the exported sequence, audio and configuration information are combined into a single file. This reduction \cc{in} file count can sometimes simplify the management and sharing of multiple sequences. However, an unexpected limitation on metadata length was encountered on Raspberry Pi \cb{platforms}. The \texttt{libav} fork of \texttt{ffmpeg} provided by the raspbian distribution of version \texttt{jessie} has an arbitrary limitation of 1000 characters for metadata field length, not enough for all XML configuration information. To work around this issue, some inactive fields of the XML configuration \cc{were} removed for Raspberry Pi \cb{platforms}. To completely remove this issue, \cc{a} newer version of \texttt{ffmpeg} without this limitation can be compiled for Raspberry Pi \cb{platforms}.

The \cc{\texttt{yuv420p}-encoded} video listed in \tref{tbl:size} \cc{was} transcoded from the \cc{\texttt{rgb24}-encoded} video using the \texttt{ffmpeg} command-line tool. This \ca{shows} another benefit of using a video file. All tools developed for \cc{general-purpose} video processing, editing and filtering can also be used \cc{directly with} the exported sequences.

With these sophisticated video \ca{compression} algorithms, a drop of the sequence loading speed was expected. Fortunately, the \texttt{ffmpeg} library is capable of utilising media acceleration features to speed up video decoding, such as SIMD instructions and dedicated video decoding hardware. However, a \cc{\ca{low}-resolution} video, such as the $76 \times 76$ video from \fref{fig:video-info}, is more than capable of supporting thousands of controller channels. It may not leverage the full advantage of dedicated high resolution hardware video decoding accelerators. \cc{Sequence designs with less than hundreds of thousands of channels may have a better loading performance using software decoding}.

  \label{fig:video-pix_fmt}
\end{figure*}

There are several possible ways to encode sequence channel data into a video pixel format. \fref{fig:video-rgb}, \ref{fig:video-yuv} and \ref{fig:video-yuvp} \cc{show the three} different channel orders tested.

For the \texttt{RGB} format, channel data was copied line-by-line into a video frame buffer with \texttt{rgb24} pixel format. The channel data \cc{sequentially fills} the red, green and blue channels of continuous pixels, also \cc{known as a} packed format.

Similarly, \fref{fig:video-yuv} was encoded as packed \texttt{YUV} for comparison. However, only \cc{the} planar pixel format \texttt{yuv444p} is available for video frames. The frame buffer stores an entire frame of \texttt{Y} channel first, followed by a frame of \texttt{U} and \texttt{V} channels. For the packed \texttt{YUV} format, this requires \cc{a} complex buffer copying routine, \ca{which} \cb{will} decrease the performance.

\fref{fig:video-yuvp} shows the appearance of storing channel data as planar \texttt{YUV} format \ca{instead}. Because the example sequence contains lots of \texttt{RGB} elements, pixels with similar colours were all separated by two other pixels in the planar format. This separation resulted in lots of sharp pixel boundaries, which can be badly degraded when transcoding to lower quality video settings\cc{, thus offering less of an opportunity for compression than packed formats}.

The second and third rows of \fref{fig:video-pix_fmt} show the quality degradation with lower quality settings using the same \texttt{rgb24} pixel format. The increase of the constant quality factor (CRF) means \cc{that} the video data rate will be more restricted and reduced. The frame difference of CRF 12 is hardly visible, but the \texttt{XOR} blend clearly shows there are binary differences to the reference frame.

Within the \cc{three} formats tested, \texttt{yuv420p} probably is the most common video encoding format currently. It is also more commonly supported by hardware video accelerators. However, \texttt{yuv420p} is not capable \cc{of storing} channel data losslessly with the same image resolution. It is more suitable for storing realistic videos, where sudden colour changes between pixels are uncritical and not common. Colour \cc{degradation} and cross-talk between channels are unavoidable with the \texttt{yuv420p} encoding format, as shown by the last row of \fref{fig:video-pix_fmt}.

\ca{
\tref{tbl:video_format} compares the difference between these video encoding formats. The differences were calculated according to \eref{eq:diff}. The PSNR (Peak \cc{Signal-to-Noise} Ratio) values were calculated using the PSNR filter from \texttt{ffmpeg}, which gives a logarithmic indication of errors between two video streams. The table shows that packed \texttt{RGB} gives the smallest file size. Therefore, \cb{packed \texttt{RGB}} was chosen as the optimal \cb{channel ordering} format.

\begin{equation}
  \frac{\sum_n^{N_f} \sum_i^{N_c} \left| A_{n,i} - B_{n,i} \right|}{N_f \times N_c \times 256} \%
  \label{eq:diff}
\end{equation}
Where $N_f$ is the number of frames, $N_c$ is the number of channels \cc{and} $A$ and $B$ are the data from input $A$ and $B$ respectively. $256$ was chosen because all channels in the test sequence are 8-bit channels.

\subsection{Performance comparison}

  \label{fig:perf}
\end{figure*}

\fref{fig:perf_RPi} shows the performance comparison between different implementations on \cc{the} Raspberry Pi B. \texttt{VixenLinky} (referenced by \texttt{raw}) \cc{had} the highest refresh rate \cc{due to} its simplicity. \texttt{VixenConsole} with the ``Raw'' sequence format (referenced by \texttt{seq}) \cc{had} the \cc{second-highest} performance. \ca{\cc{With an audio media file together with the ``Raw'' format} (referenced by \texttt{seqa}), the performance dropped negligibly.}

The unlimited playback performance \cc{dropped} to almost half when using \cc{an \texttt{rgb24}-encoded} video as the input (referenced by \texttt{v}). The performance \cc{dropped} again by a small factor when \cc{the} audio stream was also added to the video input (referenced by \texttt{va}). The \cc{video-only} playback performance of \texttt{yuv420p} encoding (referenced by \texttt{v420}) \cc{was} only a little higher than the lossless \texttt{rgb24} encoding (\texttt{v}), whereas the performance of lossless \texttt{yuv444p} encoding (referenced by \texttt{vyuv}) \cc{was} noticeably lower. Therefore, \ca{pixel format \texttt{rgb24}} is more suitable for encoding video sequences.

\ca{Performance comparisons on other platforms were also analysed. \fref{fig:perf_RPi3} and} \fref{fig:perf_Laptop} \cc{show} the performance comparison \ca{on two of them}, \ca{the Raspberry Pi 3B platform and} the \cb{same laptop running Linux}. \ca{The refresh rates easily reached a few hundreds of fps on the Raspberry Pi 3B platform, and more on the \cb{laptop}}. \ca{On the \cb{laptop}, the} maximum refresh rates \ca{reached} over 1,000 fps for playback and 10,000 fps for controllers. For the 50 fps \ca{test} sequence, the CPU usage almost never \cc{exceeded} $2 \%$. \ca{Compared} to the original Vixen application struggling to \ca{reach a} 50 fps refresh rate on Microsoft Windows, \cb{this} new playback engine definitely achieved \ca{substantial} performance improvements.

\ca{
  \fref{fig:fmts} shows performance companions \cc{between} multiple lossless combinations of video container and encoding formats on these three platforms. \tref{tbl:fmts} lists their relevant file sizes. There is only one entry with QuickTime encoding, because the QuickTime encoder from \texttt{ffmpeg} only supports \texttt{mov} and \texttt{mkv} container formats, and the \texttt{mov} container gives smaller file \cc{sizes}. Because \cb{the} \texttt{h265} encoding \cite{h265} \cb{is} not supported by \texttt{libav} on Raspberry Pi \cb{platforms}, and it did not show outstanding performance or file size optimisation on the \cb{laptop}, it was not tested on Raspberry Pi platforms.

The container formats \texttt{avi}, \texttt{mkv}, \texttt{mp4} and \texttt{mov} with the same \texttt{h264} encoding have almost the same maximum playback performance, but \texttt{mp4} and \texttt{mov} have smaller file sizes. The performance of QuickTime encoding, together with \texttt{mov} container format, almost reaches the performance of ``Raw'' sequence.

\subsection{Conclusion}

In conclusion, for highest performance, the QuickTime encoding format, together with \texttt{mov} container format and \texttt{rgb24} pixel format should be used. The \texttt{h264} encoding format with \texttt{mp4} or \texttt{mov} container format and \texttt{rgb24} pixel format is a more balanced choice between performance and file size. To further reduce file size with lossy encoding, a CRF of 12 may be used without producing noticeable artefacts \cc{for channels with linear intensity levels}.
